# Coursera Project Network - Deep Learning with PyTorch : Object Localization

## Overview
*Object Localization* is the task of locating an instance of a particular *object category* in an image, typically by specifying a tightly cropped *bounding box* centered on the instance. 

In this 2-hour project-based course: 
* We will be able to understand the Object Localization Dataset and write a custom dataset class for Image-bounding box dataset. 
* Additionally, we will apply **augmentation** for *localization* task to augment images as well as its effect on bounding box. 
    * For localization task augmentation we will use albumentation library. 
* We will plot the (image-bounding box) pair. 
* Thereafter, we will load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network using `timm` library.
* Moreover, we are going to create `train` function and `evaluator` function which will be helpful to write training loop. 
* Lastly, we will use *best trained model* to find bounding box given any image.

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the Localization Dataset
* Load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network
* Use albumentations library for Localization dataset
* Create training loop


## Guided Project Structure
This Guided Project is divided into 4 parts:
* **Project Overview:** This introductory reading material.
* **Hands-on Project:** The hands on project that we will work on together
* **Graded Quiz:** The final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the project successfully.
* **Learner Survey:** Tell us what you thought about this guided project! 

## Earn Your Certificate
After I have completed the hands-on project, I had been able to assess my knowledge using a graded assignment on Coursera. I scored higher than 80% to earn my [certificate](https://coursera.org/verify/9P5CXMNYMP2F)!
